        <h2>Tradition</h2>
        Brigham Young University (BYU) football has a rich tradition rooted in both athletic excellence and its unique
        cultural and religious values. Founded in 1922, the Cougars football program has steadily grown into a respected
        team within college football, known for its competitive spirit and commitment to academic and spiritual
        principles.
        Based in Provo, Utah, the team plays its home games at LaVell Edwards Stadium, a venue named after the legendary
        coach who transformed the program into a national contender.<br>

        <h3>Eras</h3>
        One of the most defining eras in BYU football history came under the leadership of LaVell Edwards, who coached
        the team from 1972 to 2000. Edwards introduced a revolutionary passing offense, which became a signature style
        of BYU football. Under his guidance, the Cougars claimed their first and only national championship in 1984,
        led by quarterback Robbie Bosco. This accomplishment cemented BYU's place in college football history and
        established the program as a breeding ground for elite quarterbacks.<br>

        <h4>Quarterback</h4>
        The quarterback tradition at BYU is unparalleled, with a legacy of producing top-tier players who have gone on
        to NFL stardom. Names like Steve Young, Jim McMahon, Ty Detmer, and Zach Wilson are synonymous with the
        program's
        offensive prowess. Ty Detmer, in particular, brought national attention to BYU by winning the Heisman Trophy in
        1990, the first and only Cougar to achieve this prestigious honor. This tradition underscores BYU’s reputation
        for developing dynamic playmakers under center.<br>

        <h5> Holistic approach</h5>
        BYU football has consistently emphasized a holistic approach to athlete development, reflecting the values of
        The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which sponsors the university. Players are expected to adhere
        to the school's Honor Code, which includes guidelines on dress, grooming, and personal conduct. Many players
        alsoserve two-year church missions during their collegiate careers, contributing to the team’s distinct dynamic,
        as some athletes return to the field older and more experienced.<br>

        <h6>WAC</h6>
        The Cougars have also made a name for themselves as fierce competitors, particularly during their time in the
        Western Athletic Conference (WAC) and later the Mountain West Conference (MWC). BYU has accumulated numerous
        conference championships and bowl game victories, often competing against high-profile programs. Since becoming
        an independent team in 2011, the Cougars have faced a diverse schedule, showcasing their ability to adapt and
        thrive without the confines of conference play.<br>

        
        <h6>Big 12</h6>
        In 2023, BYU entered the Big 12 Conference, marking a new chapter in the program’s evolution. Competing in a
        Power Five conference presents new challenges and opportunities for the Cougars, as they face some of the
        nation’s
        strongest teams on a regular basis. This move has been hailed as a significant step forward, providing BYU with
        greater visibility, stronger recruiting opportunities, and the chance to further solidify its reputation on a
        national stage. <br>

        Through its storied history, BYU football has become much more than a college football program.
        It represents a unique intersection of athletic achievement, academic excellence, and spiritual dedication.
        The Cougars' resilience and innovation, combined with their commitment to their values, ensure they remain a
        respected and competitive force in the ever-evolving landscape of college football. <br>
